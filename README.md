A simple Haskell fractal renderer, showcasing the strengths of a compositional approach to programming. Based on [Composing fractals, Mark P. Jones. 2004](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/composing-fractals.pdf).

`Fractals.hs` contains the abstract fractal functions, `ascii.hs` and `graphical.hs` use it to render fractals in ASCII and using the [Gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) graphics library, respectively.
